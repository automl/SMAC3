SMAC is a tool for algorithm configuration to optimize the parameters of arbitrary algorithms, including hyperparameter 
optimization of Machine Learning algorithms. The main core consists of Bayesian Optimization in combination with an 
aggressive racing mechanism to efficiently decide which of two configurations performs better.

SMAC3 is written in Python3 and continuously tested with Python 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Its Random
Forest is written in C++. In further texts, SMAC is representatively mentioned for SMAC3.

## Important: Changes in v2.0

With the next big major release of SMAC, we drastically boosted the user experience by improving the APIs and how the 
pipelining is done (see [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)). All facades/intensifiers support multi-objective, multi-fidelity, 
and multi-threading natively now! That includes having an ask-and-tell interface and continuing a run
wherever you left off. pSMAC is removed because when specifying the number of workers, SMAC automatically uses 
multi-threading for evaluating trials. When cleaning the code base, however, we removed the command-line 
interface (calling a target function from a script is still supported), and runtime optimization. Also,
python 3.7 is not supported anymore. If you depend on those functionalities, please keep using v1.4.

We are excited to introduce the new major release and look forward to developing new features on the new code base. 
We hope you enjoy this new user experience as much as we do. üöÄ


## Installation

This instruction is for the installation on a Linux system, for Windows and Mac and further information see the [documentation](https://automl.github.io/SMAC3/main/1_installation.html).

Create a new environment with python 3.10 and make sure swig is installed either on your system or
inside the environment. We demonstrate the installation via anaconda in the following:

Create and activate environment:
```
conda create -n SMAC python=3.10
conda activate SMAC
```

Install swig:
```
conda install gxx_linux-64 gcc_linux-64 swig
```

Install SMAC via PyPI:
```
pip install smac
```

Or alternatively, clone the environment:
```
git clone https://github.com/automl/SMAC3.git && cd SMAC3
pip install -e .[dev]
```


## Minimal Example

```py
from ConfigSpace import Configuration, ConfigurationSpace

import numpy as np
from smac import HyperparameterOptimizationFacade, Scenario
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

iris = datasets.load_iris()


def train(config: Configuration, seed: int = 0) -> float:
    classifier = SVC(C=config["C"], random_state=seed)
    scores = cross_val_score(classifier, iris.data, iris.target, cv=5)
    return 1 - np.mean(scores)


configspace = ConfigurationSpace({"C": (0.100, 1000.0)})

# Scenario object specifying the optimization environment
scenario = Scenario(configspace, deterministic=True, n_trials=200)

# Use SMAC to find the best configuration/hyperparameters
smac = HyperparameterOptimizationFacade(scenario, train)
incumbent = smac.optimize()
```
