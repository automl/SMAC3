SMAC is a tool for algorithm configuration to optimize the parameters of
arbitrary algorithms, including hyperparameter optimization of Machine Learning algorithms. The main core consists of
Bayesian Optimization in combination with an aggressive racing mechanism to
efficiently decide which of two configurations performs better.

SMAC3 is written in Python3 and continuously tested with Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Its Random
Forest is written in C++. In further texts, SMAC is representatively mentioned for SMAC3.

## Installation

Create a new environment with python 3.9 and make sure swig is installed either on your system or
inside the environment. We demonstrate the installation via anaconda in the following:

Create and activate environment:
```
conda create -n SMAC python=3.9
conda activate SMAC
```

Install swig:
```
conda install gxx_linux-64 gcc_linux-64 swig
```

Install SMAC via PyPI:
```
pip install smac
```

Or alternatively, clone the environment:
```
git clone https://github.com/automl/SMAC3.git && cd SMAC3
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

We refer to the [documention](https://automl.github.io/SMAC3) for further installation options.


## Minimal Example

```py
import numpy as np

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from ConfigSpace import ConfigurationSpace
from ConfigSpace.hyperparameters import UniformIntegerHyperparameter
from smac.facade.smac_bb_facade import SMAC4BB
from smac.scenario.scenario import Scenario


X_train, y_train = np.random.randint(2, size=(20, 2)), np.random.randint(2, size=20)
X_val, y_val = np.random.randint(2, size=(5, 2)), np.random.randint(2, size=5)


def train_random_forest(config):
    """ 
    Trains a random forest on the given hyperparameters, defined by config, and returns the accuracy
    on the validation data.

    Input:
        config (Configuration): Configuration object derived from ConfigurationSpace.

    Return:
        cost (float): Performance measure on the validation data.
    """
    model = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=config["depth"])
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # define the evaluation metric as return
    return 1 - model.score(X_val, y_val)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define your hyperparameters
    configspace = ConfigurationSpace()
    configspace.add_hyperparameter(UniformIntegerHyperparameter("depth", 2, 100))

    # Provide meta data for the optimization
    scenario = Scenario({
        "run_obj": "quality",  # Optimize quality (alternatively runtime)
        "runcount-limit": 10,  # Max number of function evaluations (the more the better)
        "cs": configspace,
    })

    smac = SMAC4BB(scenario=scenario, tae_runner=train_random_forest)
    best_found_config = smac.optimize()

```
