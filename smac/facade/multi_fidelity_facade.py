class MultiFidelityFacade(HyperparameterOptimizationFacade):
    """
    This facade configures SMAC in a multi-fidelity setting.
    The way this facade combines the components is the following and exploits
    fidelity information in the following form:

    1. The initial design is a RandomInitialDesign.
    2. The intensification is Hyperband. The configurations from the initial design
    are presented as challengers and executed in the Hyperband fashion.
    3. The model is a RandomForest surrogate model. The data to train it is collected by ``SMBO._collect_data``.
      Notably, the method searches through the runhistory and collects the data from the highest fidelity level,
      that supports at least ``SMBO._min_samples_model`` number of configurations.
    4. The acquisition function is ``EI``, presenting the value of a candidate configuration.
    5. The acquisition optimizer is ``LocalAndSortedRandomSearch``. It optimizes the acquisition
      function to present the best configuration as challenger to the intensifier.
      From now on 2. works as follows: The intensifier runs the challenger in a Hyperband fashion against the existing
      configurations and their observed performances until the challenger does not survive a fidelity level. The
      intensifier can inquire about a known configuration on a yet unseen fidelity if necessary.

    The loop 2-5 continues until a termination criterion is reached.

    Note
    ----
    For intensification the data acquisition and aggregation strategy in step 2 is changed.
    Incumbents are updated by the mean performance over the intersection of instances, that
    the challenger and incumbent have in common (``abstract_intensifier._compare_configs``).
    The model in step 3 is trained on all the available instance performance values.
    The datapoints for a hyperparameter configuration are disambiguated by the instance features
    or an index as replacement if no instance features are available.
