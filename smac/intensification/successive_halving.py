class _SuccessiveHalving(AbstractRacer):
    """Races multiple challengers against an incumbent using Successive Halving method.

    This class contains the logic to implement:
    "BOHB: Robust and Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization at Scale" (Falkner et al. 2018)
    Supplementary reference: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/falkner18a/falkner18a-supp.pdf

    The `SuccessiveHalving` class can create multiple `_SuccessiveHalving` objects, to
    allow parallelism in the method (up to the number of workers available). The user  interface
    is expected to be `SuccessiveHalving`, yet this class (`_SuccessiveHalving`) contains the
    actual single worker implementation of the SMAC4MF method.

    Successive Halving intensifier (and Hyperband) can operate on two kinds of budgets:

    1. **'Instances' as budget**:

       When multiple instances are provided or when run objective is "runtime",
       this is the criterion used as budget
       for successive halving iterations i.e., the budget determines how many
       instances the challengers are evaluated
       on at a time. Top challengers for the next iteration are selected based
       on the combined performance across all instances used.

       If ``initial_budget`` and ``max_budget`` are not provided, then they are
       set to 1 and total number of available instances respectively by default.

    2. **'Real-valued' budget**:

       This is used when there is only one instance provided and when run
       objective is "quality", i.e. budget is a positive, real-valued number
       that can be passed to the target algorithm as an argument.
       It can be used to control anything by the target algorithm,
       Eg: number of epochs for training a neural network.

       ``initial_budget`` and ``max_budget`` are required parameters for
       this type of budget.

class SuccessiveHalving(ParallelScheduler):
    """Races multiple challengers against an incumbent using Successive Halving method.

    Implementation following the description in
    "BOHB: Robust and Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization at Scale" (Falkner et al. 2018)
    Supplementary reference: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/falkner18a/falkner18a-supp.pdf

    Successive Halving intensifier (and Hyperband) can operate on two kinds of budgets:
    1. **'Instances' as budget**:
        When multiple instances are provided or when run objective is "runtime", this is the criterion used as budget
        for successive halving iterations i.e., the budget determines how many instances the challengers are evaluated
        on at a time. Top challengers for the next iteration are selected based on the combined performance across
        all instances used.

        If ``initial_budget`` and ``max_budget`` are not provided, then they are set to 1 and total number
        of available instances respectively by default.

    2. **'Real-valued' budget**:
        This is used when there is only one instance provided and when run objective is "quality",
        i.e., budget is a positive, real-valued number that can be passed to the target algorithm as an argument.
        It can be used to control anything by the target algorithm, Eg: number of epochs for training a neural network.

        ``initial_budget`` and ``max_budget`` are required parameters for this type of budget.

    Examples for successive halving (and hyperband) can be found here:
    * Runtime objective and multiple instances *(instances as budget)*: `examples/spear_qcp/SMAC4AC_SH_spear_qcp.py`
    * Quality objective and multiple instances *(instances as budget)*: `examples/SMAC4MF_sgd_instances.py`
    * Quality objective and single instance *(real-valued budget)*: `examples/SMAC4MF_mlp.py`

    This class instantiates `_SuccessiveHalving` objects on a need basis, that is, to
    prevent workers from being idle. The actual logic that implements the Successive halving method
    lies on the _SuccessiveHalving class.

        whether the run objective is runtime or not (if true, apply adaptive capping)
    n_seeds : Optional[int]
        Number of seeds to use, if TA is not deterministic. Defaults to None, i.e., seed is set as 0
    instance_order : Optional[str]
        how to order instances. Can be set to: [None, shuffle_once, shuffle]
        * None - use as is given by the user
        * shuffle_once - shuffle once and use across all SH run (default)
        * shuffle - shuffle before every SH run
    adaptive_capping_slackfactor : float
        slack factor of adpative capping (factor * adaptive cutoff)
    inst_seed_pairs : List[Tuple[str, int]], optional
        Do not set this argument, it will only be used by hyperband!
    min_chall: int
        minimal number of challengers to be considered (even if time_bound is exhausted earlier). This class will
        raise an exception if a value larger than 1 is passed.
    incumbent_selection: str
        How to select incumbent in successive halving. Only active for real-valued budgets.
        Can be set to: [highest_executed_budget, highest_budget, any_budget]

        * highest_budget - incumbent is selected only based on the highest budget
        * any_budget - incumbent is the best on any budget i.e., best performance regardless of budget
