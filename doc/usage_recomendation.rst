Usage Recommendation
====================
*SMAC* of course itself offers a lot of design choices, some of which are crucial to achieve peak performance. Luckily, often it is sufficient to distinguish between a few problem classes.
To make the usage of *SMAC* as easy as possible, we provide several facades designed for these different use cases. Here we give some general recommendations on
when to use which facade. These recommendations are based on our experience and technical limitations and is by far not intended to be complete:

+-----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+-------------------------+
|                       | SMAC4BO              | SMAC4HPO              | SMAC4AC                 |
+=======================+======================+=======================+=========================+
| # parameter           | low                  | low/medium/high       | low/medium/high         |
+-----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+-------------------------+
| categorical parameter | no                   | supported             | supported               |
+-----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+-------------------------+
| conditional parameter | no                   | supported             | supported               |
+-----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+-------------------------+
| instances             | no                   | None or CV-folds      | yes                     |
+-----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+-------------------------+
| stochasticity         | no                   | supported             | supported               |
+-----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+-------------------------+
| objective             | any (except runtime) | e.g. validation loss  | e.g. runtime or quality |
+-----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+-------------------------+

Some examples of typical use cases:

*SMAC4BO*: Bayesian Optimization using a *Gaussian Process* and *Expected Improvement*
   - Optimizing the objective value of Branin and other low dimensional artificial test functions
   - Finding the best learning rate for training a neural network wrt. RMSE on a validation dataset

*SMAC4HPO*: Bayesian optimization using a *Random Forest*
  - Finding the optimal choice of machine learning algorithm and its hyperparameters wrt. validation error
  - Tuning the architecture and training parameters of a neural network wrt. classification error on a validation dataset
  - Optimize hyperparameters of a SVM wrt. the CV-fold error
  - Minimize objective values of problems that are noisy and/or yield crashed runs (e.g. due to mem-outs).
  - Finding the best setting of an RL-agent to minimize regret (or a set of RL problems)

*SMAC4AC*: Algorithm configuration using a *Random Forest*
  - Minimizing the average time it takes for a SAT-solver to solve a set of SAT instances
  - Configuring a MIP solver to solve a set of mixed-integer-problems as fast as possible
  - Optimizing the average quality of solutions returned by a configurable TSP solver
