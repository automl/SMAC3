Installation
============

.. _requirements:

Requirements
------------
The random forest used in SMAC depends on a C++11 compatible compiler
and on SWIG (>3.0).

To install both requirements system-wide on a linux system with apt, 
please call:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install build-essential swig

If you use Anaconda, you have to install both gcc and SWIG from Anaconda to
prevent broken links:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install gcc swig

.. _installation_pypi:

----------------------
To install SMAC3 from pypi, please use the following command on the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

If you want to install it in the user space (e.g., because of missing
permissions), please add the option :code:`--user` or create a virtualenv.
