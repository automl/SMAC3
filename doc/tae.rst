Target Algorithm Evaluator
--------------------------

*SMAC* evaluates the algorithm to be optimized by invoking it through a Target
Algorithm Evaluator (TAE). There are different TAEs implemented in *SMAC* which
provide slightly different interfaces. You can see `SVM-example
<quickstart.html#using-smac-in-python-svm>`_ for an example on the usage.

- `smac.tae.execute_ta_run_old <apidoc/smac.tae.execute_ta_run_old.html#module-smac.tae.execute_ta_run_old>`_:
  Used when calling *SMAC* via the `commandline <basic_usage.html#commandline>`_, where it takes the algorithm call
  from the algo-parameter of the `scenario <options.html#scenario>`_.
  The parameters will be appended to the algorithm call, which in total looks
  like:

  .. code-block:: bash

      <algo> <instance> <instance specific> <cutoff time> <runlength> <seed> <algorithm parameters>
      python algo.py 123 0 10 25 12345 -param1 value1 -param2 value2 [...]

  It expects the target algorithm to print a string during
  execution with on of the following formats:

  .. code-block:: bash

      Result of this algorithm run: <STATUS>, <running time>, <runlength>, <quality>, <seed>, <instance-specifics>
      Result for SMAC: <STATUS>, <running time>, <runlength>, <quality>, <seed>, <instance-specifics>
      Result for ParamILS: <STATUS>, <running time>, <runlength>, <quality>, <seed>, <instance-specifics>

  The examples Branin_ or SPEAR_ reflect the usage.
  
  * **STATUS** can be one of [SAT, UNSAT, SUCCESS, TIMEOUT, MEMOUT, CRASHED, ABORT]. SAT and UNSAT are mainly supported for backcompatibility and are treated as SUCCESS. The difference between CRASHED and ABORT is that ABORT is called when all future calls are assumed to crash and will abort the whole optimization, whereas CRASHED only indicates a single failed run.
  * **running time** indicates the time that the execution took.
  * **runlength** indicates the number of steps needed for execution.
  * **quality** is the solution quality.
  * **seed** is the seed used for the algorithm call.
  * **instance-specifics** is additional information.

- `ExecuteTAFuncDict <apidoc/smac.tae.execute_func.html#smac.tae.execute_func.ExecuteTAFuncDict>`_ and
  `ExecuteTAFuncArray <apidoc/smac.tae.execute_func.html#smac.tae.execute_func.ExecuteTAFuncArray>`_:
  The target algorithm is called with a dict- or array-like configuration and optionally
  with seed and instance, returning either the loss as a float or a tuple (loss,
  additional information). This is very handy when used within Python to
  optimize any blackbox-function. Using this TAE, there is no need to print a
  result string; the error will be interpreted from the return value. Just be
  aware of the fact that *SMAC* is always minimizing as well as the function
  needs to be able to interpret the configuration correctly.
  With this TAE, `Pynisher <https://github.com/sfalkner/pynisher>`_ is used to
  enforce time- and memory-limits.
