:abort_on_first_run_crash: If true, *SMAC* will abort if the first run of the target algorithm crashes. Default: True.
:acq_opt_challengers: Number of challengers returned by acquisition function optimization. Also influences the number of randomly sampled configurations to optimized the acquisition function Default: 5000.
:always_race_default: Race new incumbents always against default configuration.
:hydra_iterations: number of hydra iterations. Only active if mode is set to Hydra Default: 3.
:input_psmac_dirs: For parallel SMAC, multiple output-directories are used.
:intens_adaptive_capping_slackfactork: Slack factor of adpative capping (factor * adpative cutoff). Only active if obj is runtime. If set to very large number it practically deactivates adaptive capping. Default: 1.2.
:intens_min_chall: Minimal number of challengers to be considered in each intensification run (> 1). Set to 1 and in combination with very small intensification-percentage. it will deactivate randomly sampled configurations (and hence, extrapolation of random forest will be an issue.) Default: 2.
:intensification_percentage: The fraction of time to be used on intensification (versus choice of next Configurations). Default: 0.5.
:limit_resources: If true, *SMAC* will use pynisher to limit time and memory for the target algorithm. Allows SMAC to use all resources available. Applicable only to func TAEs. Set to 'False' by default. (Warning: This only works on Linux. Use with caution!)
:maxR: Maximum number of calls per configuration. Default: 2000.
:minR: Minimum number of calls per configuration. Default: 1.
:output_dir: Specifies the output-directory for all emerging files, such as logging and results. Default: smac3-output_2022-07-14_08:13:31_599946.
:rand_prob: probablity to run a random configuration instead of configuration optimized on the acquisition function Default: 0.5.
:random_configuration_chooser: path to a python module containing a class`RandomConfigurationChooserImpl` implementingthe interface of `RandomConfigurationChooser`
:rf_do_bootstrapping: Use bootstraping in random forest. Default: True.
:rf_max_depth: Maximum depth of each tree in the random forest. Default: 20.
:rf_min_samples_leaf: Minimum required number of samples in each leaf of a tree in the random forest. Default: 3.
:rf_min_samples_split: Minimum number of samples to split for building a tree in the random forest. Default: 3.
:rf_num_trees: Number of trees in the random forest (> 1). Default: 10.
:rf_ratio_features: Ratio of sampled features in each split ([0.,1.]). Default: 0.8333333333333334.
:shared_model: Whether to run SMAC in parallel mode.
:sls_max_steps: Maximum number of local search steps in one iteration during the optimization of the acquisition function.
:sls_n_steps_plateau_walk: Maximum number of steps on plateaus during the optimization of the acquisition function. Default: 10.
:transform_y: Transform all observed cost values via log-transformations or inverse scaling. The subfix "s" indicates that SMAC scales the y-values accordingly to apply the transformation. Default: NONE.
:use_ta_time: Instead of measuring SMAC's wallclock time, only consider time reported by the target algorithm (ta).
