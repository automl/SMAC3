version 3.3.4	2013-11-28

- fix compilation problems on Ubuntu and get rid of compilation warnings

version 3.3.3	2013-07-19

- fixed a bug which occurs on very short executions of the solver
  (such as `echo test`). In such a case, runsolver did not have the time to
  get the correct process group id (i.e. the watcher read /proc
  before the child could run setpgid()) and in the end runsolver
  signalled its own process group and killed itself. Besides, the
  default ProcessTree::currentRootPID was set to 1, which means that
  we could kill our whole session (kill(-1,...))

- fixed 2 bugs in timestamping: the CPU time didn't take into
  account the lostCPUtime and the EOF line didn't appear on its own
  line when the solver didn't print an EOL at the end.

version 3.3.2	2013-04-19

- add option -v to save the most relevant information (times, ...)
  in a separate file which is easy to parse (VAR=VALUE format)

- display option --core in the help message and clarified the core
  numbering scheme used by this option

- new option --phys-core to select cores by their physical id

- new option --add-eof:

  when timestamps are used, request to add an 'EOF' line at the
  end of the solver output

version 3.3.1	2011-06-12

- make sure to kill processes which are stopped and in their own
  session

version 3.3.0	2011-05-01

- support for core information and selection
- fixed a bug in case of input redirection (runsolver cmd < file)
- use long instead of int for memory limits

version 3.2.9a	2010-03-09

- release under the GPL

version 3.2.9	2009-03-27

- when the main process terminates, kill each children that could remain

version 3.2.8	2009-03-27

- fixed a bug in the --output-limit start,max option

  when the output size was between start and max, "start" bytes of
  garbage was appended to the ouput.

- --output-limit now implies --timestamp

version 3.2.7	2009-03-26

- added the --cleanup-ipc-queues option

version 3.2.6	2009-03-24

- added support for identification of heavy processes run by another user

version 3.2.5	2007-05-20

- the stack size command line argument was incorrectly understood as a
limit in GiB instead of a limit in MiB.

version 3.2.4	2007-05-9

- add a test to indicate if the solver has dumped a core (when
supported by the system)

version 3.2.3	2007-04-16

- lostCPUTime must be taken into account when deciding when the solver
times out

- added tests to check that fgets() correctly reads the /proc/pid/stat
and statm files in ProcessData::read(). It is hoped this will fix some
incoherent data read such as:

Solver just ended. Dumping a history of the last processes samples

[startup+402.503 s]
/proc/loadavg: 1.00 0.99 0.91 1/77 12763
/proc/meminfo: memFree=1679792/2055920 swapFree=4169436/4192956

/proc/12688/statm: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Current children cumulated CPU time (s) 0
Current children cumulated vsize (KiB) 0

Notice that in the last sample, we fetch information about process
12688 but actually get information about pid 7 (and ppid is set to
-1). The most likely explanation is that the fopen("/proc/pid/stat")
succeeds but the following fgets fails because the file has
disappeared.


version 3.2.2	2007-04-13

- added code to detect when the time of a child is not reported to its
parent. When this occurs, the 'lost time' is recorded and added at the
end.  

- minors changes in the messages that are printed when the time of a
child is not reported to its parent.

version 3.2.1	2007-02-27

- added option --wall-clock-limit to deal with frozen solvers

- minor changes in the timer thread
