SMAC is a tool for algorithm configuration to optimize the parameters of
arbitrary algorithms, including hyperparameter optimization of Machine Learning algorithms. The main core consists of
Bayesian Optimization in combination with an aggressive racing mechanism to
efficiently decide which of two configurations performs better.

SMAC3 is written in Python3 and continuously tested with Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9. Its Random
Forest is written in C++. In further texts, SMAC is representatively mentioned for SMAC3.
