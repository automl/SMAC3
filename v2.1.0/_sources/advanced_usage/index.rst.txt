In this chapter, we will discuss some more advanced usage of the library. If you want to customize 
SMAC to your needs, we strongly recommend reading all pages. Since SMAC holds a lot of complex dependencies,
we can not guarantee that your customization will work. However, we can give you some hints on how SMAC
reacts to certain things.
